      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>The project 'Sentinel Drive' aims to revolutionize road safety by leveraging intelligent vehicle vigilance. Through the integration of cutting-edge technologies like AI, computer vision, and sensors, this initiative creates a responsive road safety ecosystem. Vehicles equipped with advanced computer vision algorithms and real-time sensor data can identify and prevent potential risks, ensuring the safety of all road users.<br>
      Predictive analytics further enable vehicles to anticipate hazards and proactively adjust their behaviour. Through real-time data analysis, predictive analytics, and collaborative efforts across multiple disciplines, Sentinel Drive seeks to establish a safer road environment for all, redefining the role of vehicles as vigilant partners in safeguarding lives and preventing accidents.
      The base feature is rash Driving detection, and Additional features are alcohol detection, seat-belt detection, etc. We are monitoring the Driver’s behaviour as the alert goes to officials. All data will saved on the Cloud with the help of deep learning. It obligates everyone to wear seat belts and obey traffic rules to increase the safety of individuals with the help of Innovative Road Safety through Intelligent Vehicle Vigilance and a deep learning a algorithm, embedded in Raspberry Pi. In addition to this, all the picture and video saved on a database that is only accessed by higher government officials for future security purposes and irresponsibility of law enforcement officials and Common citizens.
        </p>
      <h3>Objectives of our project</h3>
      <p>•	To develop an integrated automotive safety solution for enhanced Driver and passenger protection.<br>
      •	To create a system that monitors vehicle and road conditions in real-time, providing instant alerts and responses to potential dangers.<br>
      •	To design features that encourage responsible Driving behaviour, such as alerts for speeding, lane departure, and other risky actions.</p>
